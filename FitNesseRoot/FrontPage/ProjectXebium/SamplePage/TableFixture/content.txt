This is an example of the table fixture format

!define TEST_SYSTEM {slim}

!path target/classes
!path target/dependency/ant-1.6.5.jar
!path target/dependency/fitnesse-20100303.jar
!path target/dependency/selenium-server-2.0a5.jar
!path target/dependency/selenium-common-2.0a5.jar
!path target/dependency/selenium-2.0a5.jar
!path target/dependency/log4j-1.2.13.jar
!path target/dependency/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
!path target/dependency/commons-httpclient-3.1.jar
!path target/dependency/commons-codec-1.4.jar
!path target/dependency/servlet-api-2.5-6.1.9.jar
!path target/dependency/google-collections-1.0.jar
!path target/dependency/selenium-remote-common-2.0a5.jar
!path target/dependency/selenium-remote-client-2.0a5.jar
!path target/dependency/selenium-firefox-driver-2.0a5.jar


|Import|

The used format should be
|comment |
| check | do | !-${command}-! | on | !-${target}-! |
| check | do | !-${command}-! | on | !-${target}-! | with | !-${value}-! |

The script (used in the basic fixture) would turn out something like:

|script|selenium driver fixture|
| start browser | firefox | on url | www.google.com |
| ensure | do | open | on | / |
| ensure | do | type | on | q | with | xebium is the new test solution |
| stop browser |

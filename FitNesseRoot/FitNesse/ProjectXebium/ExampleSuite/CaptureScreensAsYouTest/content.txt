Demonstrate how to make a test run tracable by capturing screenshots automatically after every execution step

There are basically 2 versions: create a screenshot after every action (not verify-/assert-), or create a screenshot when a test fails.

|script|
| save screenshot after | !-failure/error/every step/step/nothing/none-! |
| save screenshot after | !-failure/error/every step/step/nothing/none-! | in folder | http://files/testResults/screenshots |
| save screenshot after | every step | in folder | http://files/testResults/screenshots/${PAGE_NAME} |

| script | selenium driver fixture |
| start browser | firefox | on url | http://localhost:${FITNESSE_PORT}/ |
| save screenshot after | every step | in folder | http://files/testResults/screenshots/${PAGE_NAME} |
| ensure | do | open | on | !-/FitNesse.ProjectXebium.ExampleSuite.VariablesExample-! |
| ensure | do | setTimeout | on | 1000 |
| $pageName= | is | getText | on | //span |
| $title= | is | getTitle |
| ensure | do | click | on | link=Search |
| ensure | do | waitForElementPresent | on | //form[@action='search'] |
| ensure | do | type | on | searchString | with | $pageName |
| ensure | do | click | on | searchType |
| ensure | do | waitForTextPresent | on | $title |
| note | And now do the same thing with an error in the test: |
| save screenshot after | error |
| ensure | do | open | on | !-/FitNesse.ProjectXebium.ExampleSuite.VariablesExample-! |
| ensure | do | click | on | link=Search |
| note | check is verified for. We want this to pass, so define a 'reject' rule. |
| reject | do | verifyElementPresent | on | //form[@action='nosearch'] |
| stop browser |

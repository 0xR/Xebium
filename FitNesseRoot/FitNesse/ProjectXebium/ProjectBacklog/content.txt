|06      |'''As a test user I have a generic mechanism for defining context for an application under test.'''         |            |
|        |- fields and values can be easily specified which can be used for data driven testing.                      |            |

Note: Selenium IDE contains a lot of commands. Not all are implemented by the current CommandProcessor. E.g. ''verifyTextPresent''
should invoke ''isTextPresent'' and ''verifyTextNotPresent'' should also invoke ''isTextPresent'' and invert the result.

This is an exercise still to be performed.

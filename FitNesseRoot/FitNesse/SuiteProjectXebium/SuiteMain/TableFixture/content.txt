This is an example of the table fixture format

The used format should be
|comment |
| check | do | !-${command}-! | on | !-${target}-! |
| check | do | !-${command}-! | on | !-${target}-! | with | !-${value}-! |

The script (used in the basic fixture) would turn out something like:

|script|selenium driver fixture|
| start browser | firefox | on url | www.google.com |
| ensure | do | open | on | / |
| ensure | do | type | on | q | with | xebium is the new test solution |
| stop browser |

This is an example of the table fixture format

The used format should be
|comment |
| check | do | !-${command}-! | on | !-${target}-! |
| check | do | !-${command}-! | on | !-${target}-! | with | !-${value}-! |

|import|
|com.xebia.incubator.xebium|

The script (used in the basic fixture) would turn out something like:

|comment|
|script|selenium driver fixture|
| start browser | firefox | on host | localhost | on port | 4444 | on url | http://www.google.com |
| ensure | do | open | on | / |
| ensure | do | type | on | q | with | xebium is the new test solution |
